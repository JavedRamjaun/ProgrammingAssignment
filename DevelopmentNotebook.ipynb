        "Unit Testing \n",
        "\n",

        "Version Control\n",
        "\n",
        "Use a version control system like git to keep track of changes made to the code. This will help in reverting back to a previous state in case of any issues.\n",

        "\n",
        "Peer code review is an effective practice where others review your code to spot mistakes and suggest improvements.\n",

        "Use a CI/CD tool to automatically test, build and deploy your code. This ensures that your codebase remains clean and deployable at any point of time.\n",

        "\n",
        "Implement proper error handling to ensure that the system fails gracefully in case of unexpected events.\n",

        "Data Validation\n",

        "Ensure the validity of the data being processed. This includes checking for and handling missing or inconsistent values.\n",

        "Security\n",
        "\n",
        "Be aware of potential security risks, such as SQL injection attacks when dealing with databases. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to mitigate these risks.\n",
